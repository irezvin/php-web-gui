PWG framework allows to create rich interactive web applications with complex logic using pure PHP. Widgets are written in Javascript, but all events are processed serverside. PWG uses YUI library for most of its client-side code. The framework is intended to build complex interactive web applications like CMS backends, intranet apps or WebOS-like desktops. It uses Avancore library as foundation and as a data layer.

Note that alhough the framework is used in several production solutions by its author and current version begins with 0.2, it is considered being at a very alpha stage.
